# Andy or not Andy

This project will take images and check if they are Andy or not Andy. The goal of this is to start to understand how tensorflow works, and build a basic image recognition program. We will then add a server component where you can upload an image.

## Getting Started

Install Pipenv, its magic. Other than that use linux.

### Prerequisites

You should just need python3 as well as pipenv. Pipenv should do the rest.

### Installing

Install pipenv, I will assume you already have python3 installed.

Pipenv install

```
pip install pipenv
```

And install the dependencies. 

```
pipenv install
```

then activate the shell, this will put you into the virtual instance of python used for this program.
```
pipenv shell
```
finally run using normal python commands. IE:
```
python ml.py
```

## Versioning

Why bother doing any version control. I am using python 3.5 because that is default and it works so that is good enough for me.
